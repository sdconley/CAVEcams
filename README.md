# CAVEcams
CAVEcam is a stereoscopic panorama.

As an undergraduate researcher, I earned two National Science Foundation REU grants to research 3D visualization with Dr. Thomas DeFanti, Director of Visualization at Qualcomm Institute. Serving as project lead for two years, I created 3D 360-degree panoramas for virtual reality platforms with data provided by partners at universities and National Geographic. My work is still frequently presented at research conferences.
